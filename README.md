## Background 
My friends and I were spending some time stressing about inflation rates and the rising prices of rent in our city (and our shared fear of homelessness as a result). We tried to look up rates of homelessness but were met with dull tables and graphs. I decided to try changing this. 


## Objective 
Create an appealing, informative visual detailing rates of homelessness in the United States. 

## Tools and Packages 
For this project, I used R in combination with the following packages: 
- shiny: Building interactive web apps 
- shinydashboard: Dashboard layouts for shiny apps
- openxlsx: Reading & writing Excel workbooks
- leaflet: JavaScript library for interactive maps 
- tigris: Downloading shapefiles 
- rgdal: Working with geospatial data
- tidyverse: Data manipulation & visualization
- viridis: Appealing color palettes 
- pacman: Package manager
